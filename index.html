				<h2>Report - Day 10</h2>
				<h3>12:26 AM</h3>
				<p>Andrew and I are stalking the Izanagis since 13 days now. We have explored a few dozen lakes below the Equator without much luck and have decided to relocate in the northern hemisphere near Maxwell Montes. Being a cold area, the Snow Barnaby's Tusk are usually slow and fat there, acting as delightfull preys.</p>
				<p>We don't really know what to expect, "G" has only encountered their victims's shredded bodies and was a bit reluctant to relate the exact details. Anyway, as he gently reminded us before we embark for New Venus: "Make United Kingdom proud!".</p>
				<h3>06:03 PM</h3>
				<p>Andrew did a few drawings this afternoon while I focused on the Rayguns maintenance, those damn Pearce models and New Venus weather don't really play well together, probably the watertight joints having a hard time with the temperature shifts. Once back, I'll have to discuss about the issue with "G".</p>

				<h2>Report - Day 11</h2>
				<h3>12:32 AM</h3>
				<p>Capturing two Tusk was easier than what we thought, they were caught offguard while eating some berries and promptly zapped. We will use them as baits. Andrew took a new look at the artist impressions package "G" gave us and told me laughing: <b>"Ha! I hope the real ones are scarier than those drawings!".</b></p>
				<h3>03:58 PM</h3>
				<p>We finally installed the proximity sensors around the closest small acid lake. Salt density is incredibly high there, I suspect that those lakes rarely freeze, even under New Venus winter winds.</p>
				<h3>04:07 PM</h3>
				<p>Let's the hunt begin!</p>

				<h2>Report - Day 12</h2>
				<h3>7:23 AM</h3>
				<p>Sensor number 9 alarm roused us from sleep: we are getting prepared as fast as we can!</p>
				<h3>9:47 AM</h3>
				<p>Operation is a brilliant success: we managed to get two specimens photographied!</p>
				<p>Unfortunately for Andrew, his left arm had a lot to do with it.</p>
				<p>We are now heading back to headquarter to bring the data to "G". Andrew need a new arm!</p>
				<h3>10:03 AM</h3>
				<p>Andrew is unhinged and wants to go back to vaporize the creatures: <b>"Ripped off my arm? Ha, how dare he! Iâ€™m British!"</b>.</p>
